    <p> “I never thought of making a project with something I barely knew..But neverthless it was a fun task and its cool to test new features and actually use them in making something real and useful . so here is my attempt at making something from scratch.”

    <p>"so just a quick note about myself ,<br>
      I hail from Visakhapatnam city , Andhra pradesh , a beautiful coastal city . I believe that a good work life balance is the thing that gives us maximum productivity . I find this world mysterious yet always ready to teach us new things , so I try my best to learn new things which seem intresting . In this modern world , the rich become richer and the poor become poorer and its mainly because of business . So I like to get to know more about how business world works and see if there is a way to bring sustainability and comfort to ordinary people while maintaining a healthy profit that can be used for the welfare of people and country.
